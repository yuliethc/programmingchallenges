Data Scientist Role Play Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet
This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.
In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.
For both parts of this assignment, use this worksheet. It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.

Part 1 Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding
1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below

i. Attribute table =10000
ii. Business table =10000
iii. Category table =10000
iv. Checkin table =10000
v. elite_years table =10000
vi. friend table = 10000
vii. hours table =10000
viii. photo table = 10000
ix. review table = 10000
x. tip table = 10000
xi. user table = 10000



2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.
i. Business = 10000
ii. Hours =1562
iii. Category =2643
iv. Attribute =1115
v. Review = id = 10000
vi. Checkin = 493
vii. Photo = business_id =  6493
viii. Tip = user_id  = 537
ix. User = 10000
x. Friend = 11
xi. Elite_years = 2780
Note Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.	

3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table Indicate yes, or no.

	Answer NO

ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews
Yes, they have a different distribution of reviews:
+------------------------+------------------------+
| TotalReviews_4_5_Stars | TotalReviews_2_3_Stars |
+------------------------+------------------------+
|                    206 |                     86 |
+------------------------+------------------------+
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups Explain.

Yes, the group of the businesses with 2-3 stars are located relatively close between them according to the latitude, longitude and two of them are in de same neighborhood.


+------------------+------------------------+-----------------------+-------------+----------+----------+
| name             | neighborhood           | address               | postal_code | latitude | longitude |+------------------+------------------------+-----------------------+-------------+----------+---------+
| Big Smoke Burger | Downtown Core          | 260 Yonge Street      | M4B 2L9     |  43.6546 |  -79.3805 |
| 99 Cent Sushi    | Downtown Core          | 389 Church Street     | M5B 2E5     |  43.6614 |   -79.379 |
| Pizzaiolo        | Entertainment District | 270 Adelaide Street W | M5H 1X6     |  43.6479 |  -79.3901 |+------------------+------------------------+-----------------------+-------------+----------+----------


While in the group of the businesses with 4-5 stars not, I can infer that they are not relatively close like the other group, on the contrary they are all in different neighborhoods.

3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.
Ideas for analysis include Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do
        I selected parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis to find the beloved and most loved business.
         ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data
I choose to analyze reviews given to business trough matching common used words to express love or hate, in this case I chose:
Love words	Hate words
love	hate
like	bad
best	mad
good	wait
great	complaint
tasty	never
happy	
delicious	
favorite	
I’m going to find de result of the sum of all the love and hate words to learn sentiments of users who visit those businesses in all categories, in order to discover the most beloved business of all and also learn other hate sentiments that could it had.
